# Uchiha Board

Uchiha Board is that one keyboard you wish you had ages ago  
It doesn’t try too hard, doesn’t scream gamer, doesn’t light up your whole desk  
It’s just smooth, clean, fast, and stupidly fun to use  
Looks simple but hits way harder than any of those overpriced store-bought keyboards  
Built from scratch, like actual start-to-finish grind, just because nothing else felt good enough

## how it started

It all kicked off during one of those random nights when the vibes were off and my keyboard just wasn’t giving  
Like I’m trying to get stuff done and the keyboard is out here lagging, flexing extra keys I don’t need, and feeling like a sponge  
So I closed everything, opened KiCad, and went full keyboard-goblin mode  
Started sketching out something that felt like mine  
Didn’t wanna go crazy with layout changes, so I stuck with something normal but fixed literally everything else

Redid the matrix from scratch so it’s way more responsive  
Kept the routing super clean  
Threw in hot swap sockets cause who’s got time for desoldering  
And yeah, gave it a solid case that doesn’t move unless you move it  
Now it’s this one-piece board that just works wherever  
At school, at home, in your bag, doesn’t matter  
Looks chill, performs like a beast  
And yeah it was a full solo mission because stock keyboards were too mid

## why i think it’s actually sick

So this board has MX support which basically means it’ll take any switch you throw at it  
Doesn’t split, doesn’t bend, doesn’t act weird  
Just a clean rectangle of power  
The layout is straight up solid, nothing extra, just full-row real estate for max typing flow

It runs on an rp2040 which is literally one of the best things ever  
Firmware flashing is so easy it’s actually fun  
You could run QMK or VIA on this thing before your coffee even finishes brewing  
Rotary encoder support? Yup, added that too cause why not  
Matrix is tight, rows and columns are super balanced so typing feels like butter  
And the case? Fully 3D printable, no weird gaps, zero rattle, everything fits perfectly  
Honestly it’s not even just a keyboard, it’s a whole vibe

Not cheap but definitely not ridiculous for a full custom keyboard that doesn’t suck
