# SwiftBoard

This is SwiftBoard  
a no-nonsense, smooth layout keyboard that still slaps way harder than any off-the-shelf stuff  
it’s clean, sleek, and custom from the ground up  
basically a full-send from idea to PCB to flex-worthy typing experience

Designed by Chandan for the Highway YSWS project, SwiftBoard is all about workflow flow  
no distractions, no weird gimmicks  
just pure, raw, programmable keyboard power  
if MeowBoard was the chaotic twin, SwiftBoard is the one who gets stuff done

## how it started

It all started during one of those late-night sessions when the standard keyboards just weren’t vibing right  
There was too much going on and not enough control  
So I fired up KiCad and started drafting something that felt *right*  
Went with a standard layout but tuned the matrix for minimal latency and max precision  
Kept the routing neat, dropped in hot swap sockets, and gave it a solid frame  
SwiftBoard became this clean, single-piece board that works anywhere, anytime  
Not flashy, but definitely a beast under the hood  
And yeah, it was built from scratch just because the default wasn’t good enough

## what’s actually on this thing

SwiftBoard runs an MX-compatible, hot-swappable layout with full-row support  
No splits, no gaps — just a solid slab of productivity  
Supports a Pro Micro or Elite-C for easy firmware flashing  
Includes rotary encoder support and even has per-key backlight footprints if you’re into that  
The matrix is clean, rows and columns are balanced and optimized  
You could run QMK or VIA on this thing in under 5 minutes  
And the case? 3D printable, tight tolerances, and zero rattle  
It’s not just a board. It’s a vibe.
